<p id="aboutMe">I was born and raised in Washington State. Over the past couple years I had the oppurtunity to join travel the United
    States through the U.S. Army. I traveled to Fort. Leonardwood Missouri, Fort. Sill Oklahoma, Fort.Drum New York, and even
    Fort. Polk Louisiana. For me these experiences are where my life really started. I was no one before
    I joined, and now through the support and the mentorship of many of Americas best I feel I have
    the tools and will power to get where I need to be. 
    <p id="aboutMe">
        When I got out of the Army I traveled to Oklahoma
        with a friend and leared about the rough of the country. Meeting people with different Ideologies and mindsets of
        what they believe America to be. From Country farmers, ranch hands, and even city folk who want nothing to do with the
        country. And than I moved to Texas with the assistance of my Mother and I'm making my own life now here.
