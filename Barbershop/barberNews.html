        This week at Crazy Cats Crazy Cuts. A man by the name of Owen Stevens requested a haircut
        that was so spectacular not even we could quite understand what he was getting at. We belive
        the man to have been cracked out. But never the less, we fulfilled our mission and delivered
        his haircut to his home. He than sent us a video of how the hair would not fit his cats head.
        We apologized and quickly gave the man what we owed him.
